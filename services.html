          <div class="section-container-spacer">
            <p>The problem with many organizations worldwide is that the exepcted outcome of a job one is doing is not
              clearly defined. Result is that one ends up being appraised on something at the end of the year of which
              neither he was made aware of in the beginning of the year nor during the entire year worst is that most of
              the time the appraisal is on many subjective KRAs which are extremely difficult to measure. Media being no
              exception, had similar kind of issues where the managers rating their subordinates on either subjective
              KRAs or no clear defined KRAs leaving enough ambiguity and heartburn thereafter.

              We embarked upon the journey of Gallup Q12 first Question which states 'I know what is expected of me at
              work' and put Objectivity in KRAs of all the roles resulting into something which can be measured and is
              data based. The role holder himself knows his performance clearly during the entire year thereby relieving
              him of a false sense of achievement. It becomes easier for manager also to do performance appraisal since
              data speaks for itself. This helps in a better expectation management during appraisals and less
              heartburns during and after the process.

              Subsequently a Job Directory was created where each role, its purpose, Job Family and KRAs are mentioned
              which acts as a bible for recruiters and HR team across the organization.

              Parallely a Manpower and Salary Benchmarking study for a National Hindi News Channel and a Regional
              Channel was also created for Times to be used for all hiring decisions.
